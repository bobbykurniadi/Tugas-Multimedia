			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Roseanne Park (born 11 February 1997), better known by the mononym Rosé (Korean: 로제), is a New Zealand singer and dancer based in South Korea. Rosé signed with South Korean label YG Entertainment following an audition in 2012, training there for four years. She eventually made her debut as the main vocalist in the girl group Blackpink in August 2016. As a solo artist, she has featured in labelmate G-Dragon's 2012 track "Without You", which peaked at number ten on the Gaon Music Chart.</p>
			<h4><span>1997–2015: Early life and career</span></h4>
			<p>Roseanne Park (Korean: 박채영; Park Chae-young) was born on 11 February 1997 in Auckland, New Zealand, to South Korean immigrant parents. She has an older sister. In 2004, at the age of seven, Rosé and her family moved to Melbourne, Australia. Rosé initially attended Kew East Primary School graduating in 2009, attending Canterbury Girls' Secondary College in Melbourne for her secondary schooling. She began singing and learned to play guitar and piano as a child and performed in church choirs.<br>

			In 2012, 16-year-old Rosé attended an audition in Australia for South Korean record label YG Entertainment at her father's suggestion and was ranked first among 700 participants. Within two months, she dropped out of school, signed with the label and moved to Seoul. Rosé initially thought her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas, stating:<br>

			In Australia, I didn't think that there was much of a chance for me to become a singer, especially to become a K-pop star... I was living so far from the country that it never really occurred to me as a possibility.<br>

			The same year, Rosé was given an opportunity to feature on labelmate G-Dragon's song "Without You" off his EP One of a Kind (2012). Her name was not publicised at the time of release with her credit revealed following her announcement as a Blackpink member. The song peaked at number ten on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart and at number 15 on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100.<br></p>

			<h4><span>2016–present: Debut with Blackpink</span></h4>
			<p>Rosé trained at YG Entertainment for four years before her announcement as a member of Blackpink in June 2016. She was the last member to be revealed. The group debuted in August 2016 with the single album Square One, which produced the lead singles "Whistle" and ''Boombayah".<br>

			The singer has also appeared on a variety of broadcast programmes such as music shows King of Masked Singer and Fantastic Duo 2. Her vocal performance on King of Masked Singer was met with a warm reception by the audience, to which Rosé commented that she "didn't know if the audience would like [her] singing" and that she felt "happy and relieved" at the positive result. Rosé later appeared as a performer on the second season of Fantastic Duo. The show's production staff stated that her appearance was intended to "reveal Rosé's vocal appeal, which is different from Blackpink". On June 2, 2020, YG Entertainment announced that Rosé would debut solo in 2020, following the release of Blackpink's first full album.</p>
